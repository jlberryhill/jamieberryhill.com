Since 2016, I have served as an official at the [OECD](https://oecd.org), a global forum for international collaboration and progress. The OECD is a Paris-based international organization with 38 member countries. Its primary goal is to shape policies that foster prosperity, equality, opportunity, and well-being for all.

I currently serve as a project lead and policy analyst at the [OECD.AI Policy Observatory](https://oecd.ai), a team working with governments to shape public policies for responsible, trustworthy, and beneficial artificial intelligence (AI).

Before this, I worked as an Innovation Specialist for the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation ([OPSI](https://oecd-opsi.org)) ([@OPSIgov](https://twitter.com/OPSIgov)). OPSI works with governments to understand and encourage new approaches to address society’s complex problems by empowering public servants with new insights, knowledge, tools, and connections to help them explore new possibilities. 

The projects below highlight some of my favorite work so far.

## Artificial intelligence futures
While AI policy discussions often cover existing AI challenges, the long-term implications of rapidly advancing AI systems remain largely unknown and fiercely debated. Experts raise a wide range of potential future risks from AI, some of which are already manifesting in various ways (e.g., bias, discrimination, surveillance, lack of accountability, job displacement, and mass manipulation). Many experts are concerned about the ability to ensure increasingly general AI systems are safe and aligned with human values, prevent their misuse, and address other negative societal impacts. Future benefits of AI may be just as great, with the potential to address complex issues, improve health and education outcomes, and accelerate scientific progress. 

I jointly (along with the OECD [Strategic Foresight Unit](https://www.oecd.org/strategic-foresight/) lead efforts to help governments address potential challenges and seize benefits by providing them with insights into the possible futures of AI and equipping them with the knowledge and tools necessary to develop forward-looking AI policies. 

A key part of this work has been the building of the OECD Expert Group on AI Futures, a multi-disciplinary group that comprises 60 leading AI and foresight experts from an array of governments, companies, universities, and civil society organizations.

## Tracking global innovation trends

One of my OPSI's mission objectives is to “uncover emerging practice and identify what’s next.” To help achieve this, I managed an annual project to conduct research and host an open ‘Call for Innovations’ crowdsourcing exercise. In this, we sought to uncover innovative projects going on around the world. We analyzed these cases and surface key trends, challenges, and success factors in innovation today, as well as examples and stories to illustrate them and recommendations to help support innovation.

We recently launched our [2023 edition](https://oe.cd/trends2023), with trends on algorithmic accountability, integrated and tech-eneabled healthcare, innovative social equity programs, and the evolution of public engagement. In addition to reports, we develop digital stories to help users better understand these trends and cases.

## Tech primers for public servants

Hype around emerging technologies often overstates or obscures their practical applications. An understanding of these technologies is important for helping policy makers and civil servants determine whether they can help them achieve their missions.

To help public officials navigate this complex terrain, distinguish hype from reality, and be better informed about what these technologies may mean in their own context, I've led teams of brilliant people to create tech "primers" that seek to: 
* •	Highlight key background details and provide accessible, contextualized explanations of technical underpinnings.
* Assess the current global landscape of the technology.
* Surface implications and provide recommendations to government.
* Illustrate key practices and initiatives through case studies.

So far, we've created two tech primers: one on [Artificial Intelligence](https://oecd-opsi.org/ai-primer-blog/), and one on [Blockchain](https://oecd-opsi.org/new-opsi-guide-to-blockchain-in-the-public-sector/). You can access each below.

## Innovation case study platform and COVID-19 response tracker

I'm the overall project manager for the [OPSI website](https://oecd-opsi.org). One of my favorite projects has been leading the development and ongoing iteration of one of OPSI’s lead services: a digital [case study platform](https://oecd-opsi.org/innovations) where innovations can be collected and shared to help disseminate good ideas. Any public sector innovator may submit innovations to the platform and at present there are about 400 cases on the platform, with new cases being added regularly.

Recently, we also built a similar platform as a [COVID-19 Innovative Response Tracker](https://oecd-opsi.org/covid-response) that collects and shares innovative response practices by governments and public interest organizations in hopes that hey can inspire action, enable shared learning, embed
successes and accelerate change. Anyone can [submit details](https://oecd-opsi.org/covid-response-form) on a response, which are immediately published on the tracker.

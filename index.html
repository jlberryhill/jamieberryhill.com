		<h1>Hi, I'm Jamie.</h1>
		<p>Iâ€™m an artificial intelligence (AI) analyst and project lead at the OECD.AI Policy Observatory, a team working with governments to help the manage risks and reap the benefits of AI through new approaches to policy, regulation and international collaboration. Before this, I served as an Innovation Specialist at the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), helping governments to understand, test, and embed new ways of doing things. In my pre-OECD days, I led the White House digital government policy team and conducted data-driven program reviews for the US Congress at the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p> 
			<p>I'm passionate about positively transforming economies, societies, and governments through innovation and technology. This site showcases some of my work.</p>
